**Hi, I'm Rowan!** ğŸ‘‹

I'm currently the Lead Architect for Data Protection @ [Interactive](https://www.interactive.com.au) and based in Brisbane, Australia ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º&puncsp;. My role currently oversees the design, implementation and productisation of new capabilities for our private cloud customers.

Previously I've consulted at many large businesses, education providers and government agencies to optimise, design and deploy top-tier data management solutions built on [Commvault](https://www.commvault.com/)'s Intelligent Data Services.

I'm passionate about understanding how DevOps and Infrastructure-as-Code fit into a modern and progressive business and keep myself busy in my downtime, continuing to learn about:

- ğŸ—ƒ&ensp;Git version control and Semantic versioning
- ğŸš‚&ensp;Continuous Integration/Development
- ğŸ›³&ensp;Docker and Kubernetes in a micro-service context
- ğŸ•¸&ensp;Service Mesh's
- ğŸ› &ensp;Ansible
